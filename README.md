# Brunchie
Brunchie is web application that provides a listing of restaurants offering brunch or breakfast. The idea of the app is to streamline the process of finding a restaurant or a café that offers brunch or breakfast. Restaurants and cafés are added to the app by their owners. A restaurant/café includes, at minimum: a name, an adress, a link to its homepage and the price of the current menu along with a short description of the items in it. Also, customers can add reviews about the restaurants/cafés they have visited.


### Application structure
The application will consist of a Django back-end and a React front-end that are connected via RESTful API calls.

### Development status
Currently the focus is in implementing the Django back-end, after which the frond-end will be created.
